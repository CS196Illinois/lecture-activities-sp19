# Data Science Activity
In today's activity, you will be downloading the student_data.csv file and will be working with the data in it.

The first thing you need to do place the data from the CSV into a pandas dataframe. You will likely need to look up pandas documentation for several of the exercises here. Numpy will also be extremely useful.

## Exercise 1

1. identify the columns (attributes) available for each student in this dataset.

2. identify how many students are in this dataset.

3. How many different nationalities are represented by the dataset?

4. How many students are there for each nationality?

5. How many times did the average student raise their hand?

6. What is the median number of hand raises across all students?

7. How many male students are there?

## Exercise 2
Now that you have general idea of how to use a dataframe, lets try something a bit harder.

1. Students of which nationality visited resources most frequently? How many total times did students of this nationality visit resources?

2. How many times did the average Egyptian male raise their hand?

3. How many male students from Kuwait (KW) viewed at least 30 announcements?

## Exercise 3
Here we will be working with plotting. You will want to use matplotlib or the pandas' plotting. Make sure to include axis titles, chart titles, and legend if needed!

1. Plot a histogram of the number of times students from Jordan visited resources.

2. Plot a pie chart showing how many times students of each nationality raised their hand.

3. Plot a bar graph showing how many discussions the average student for each (grade, gender) pair attended. For example, your your graph should show many many discussions an average male in G-04 attended, or how many discussions the average female in G-07 attended.
